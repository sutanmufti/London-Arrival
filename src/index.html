                    London has 5 international airports, although they are not actually located in London. Despite so, the proximities to the city make them the major destinations for people to travel to.
                    
                    Relatively they have the same distance to the city centre, but they feel far when we zoom in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Likely you will arrive at the <b>Heathrow Airport</b> as marked by the map. This is the airport that I arived to when I first arrived in London! We'll talk about this later.

                <p>
                    The famous Big Ben, Covent Garden, Westminster Abbey, they all are located in the city centre.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you first arrive in London, I think you'd want to visit these places. These are the first-thing-first to visit in London! They are touristy, and I think you will love the locations.

                        But they are a bit far away from where you'll arrive.

                <p>
                    Heathrow is located at the edge of London, to be precise, Zone 6!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some trivia, airports are often located at the edges of cities. The reason is mainly for safety concern! another reason is because it produces air polution for the neighbours. Anyway...
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are 2 main options for you to get to the city centre:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The Elizabeth Line (brand new, btw)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The Underground
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </section>
            <section class="step">
                <h2>
                    The Elizabeth Line!
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I would recommend for you to ride the Elizabeth Line to London! When I first arrived in London, I did not even know this line exists (at the time it was the Tfl Rail)! So I took the picadilly line (which is the next option) and took an hour ride long! To be fair, my acommodation was next to a picadilly line station.

                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>
                        This is the quickest way to London.
                    </b>
                    <p>
                        It takes around 30 minutes to travel to London with the Elizabeth Line, and even faster with Heathrow Express. You will arrive at the <b>Paddington Station</b> and you can connect to other service from there.
                    </p>

                <h2>
                    The Underground: Picadilly Line 
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Another option is using the Underground. This is the classic public transportation that goes... underground. The first, actually, so it has a very high historical value. The line that connects Heathrow and the city centre (directly) is <b>the Picadilly Line</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Look at the map, the coverage is higher than Elizabeth Line! You can get to the edge of the city, and go directly to the city centre! However, there are also a lot of stops, so it will take a while!

                <p>
                    Now let's see the stations as you will not disembark between the stations. Picadilly line goes directly to the city centere. If you are going direcly, then this is the best option. If you are not going directly and want to go quicker, you can ride the Elizabeth Line. You need to transfer to go direcly to the city cetnre, but it won't take long!

                    Some tips on ticket:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Buy Oyster Card at Heathrow. There are machines that dispense oyster card. This applies for The Underground and Elizabeth Line!</li>
                        <li>Use contactless card: you don't want to buy one. You can directly tap at the station gate and get in the station. When you exit, tap out at the exit gate.</li>
